      Clinical trials are essential for ensuring the safety and efficacy of drugs, however the vetting process is expensive.
      Many drugs fail because the adverse effects they cause in patients are intolerable. High throughput
      drug screening approaches have made it possible to test the effects of new drugs on isolated cells,
      however, screening for toxic effects is more difficult. <br>

      <p><p> Adversio predicts drug side effects based on known molecular targets. Input the known molecular targets
      for your drugs of interest and I will help you prioritize which candidates to develop further based on reducing
      adverse effects.

      <p><b> Under the Hood </b>

      <p>I use a multi-label logistic regression model trained on data collected from DrugBank
        and the Canada Vigilance Adverse Reaction Online Database. Want to know more?
